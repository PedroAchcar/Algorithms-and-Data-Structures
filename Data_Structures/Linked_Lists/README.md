## Types of Linked Lists Implemented

This directory contains implementations of different linked lists, each with its own **README.md** file explaining the specifics:

1. **Singly Linked List** (`Singly_Linked_List/`)
   - Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
   - Supports insertions, deletions, and searching operations.

2. **Doubly Linked List** (`Doubly_Linked_List/`)
   - Each node has two pointers: one for the next node and one for the previous node.
   - Allows traversal in both directions.

3. **Circular Singly Linked List** (`Circular_Linked_List/`)
   - Similar to a singly linked list but the last node points back to the head.
   - Useful for cyclic processes such as round-robin scheduling.

4. **Circular Doubly Linked List** (`Circular_Doubly_Linked_List/`)
   - A doubly linked list where the last node links back to the head and vice versa.
   - Efficient for implementing queues and buffering systems.

## Overview
Each linked list implementation provides:
- **Insertion methods** (beginning, specific position, and end)
- **Deletion methods** (beginning, specific position, and end)
- **Search function** to locate a node
- **Print functions** to display the linked list
- **Length function** to return the number of nodes

Refer to each subdirectory for detailed explanations and usage instructions.
